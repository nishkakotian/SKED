# SKED

A full-stack venue booking web application built using Parse and SashiDo.It has two main types of users ie. Customers and Venue owners.

A customer can :

- Find details about venues and filter them based on location  
- Check time slots that have already been booked for any day  
- Send a booking request to the owner of that venue  

An owner can :  

- Add a venue  
- Get bookings made for the present day  
- Approve booking requests made by customers  
- Delete bookings for events that have finished
